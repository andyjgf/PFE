# PFE
This is the repository for the W3C Progressive Font Enrichment specification, developed by the W3C Web Fonts working group.

The pre-standardization [simulation work](https://github.com/w3c/PFE-analysis) which informs this specification is summarized and explained in an [Evaluation Report](https://www.w3.org/TR/PFE-evaluation/). 

The previous work on [WOFF and WOFF 2.0 File Formats](https://github.com/w3c/woff) is also available.
